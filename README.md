The **EmployeeChurn_App** is a **desktop application** built with **PySide2** that performs **survival analysis** on employee data to visualize retention patterns. It loads an Excel file containing employee records and automatically preprocesses the data by converting date columns, calculating employment duration, generating an event indicator for churn, and deriving age and experience groups. The application then displays interactive **Kaplan‑Meier survival curves** stratified by **age group**, **experience group**, and **department**, and fits a **Cox proportional hazards model** whose variable significance is shown as a horizontal bar chart. The interface uses a stacked widget with simple buttons to switch between the different graph pages, providing an intuitive way to explore employee churn dynamics.

The **Forecasting_model** project implements a monthly **time‑series forecasting pipeline** using **NeuralProphet**. It reads a CSV file with historical budget data, automatically renames columns for compatibility, and handles monthly frequency. The data is split into training and testing sets, and a NeuralProphet model with **multiplicative seasonality** is trained to capture trends and seasonality. The pipeline generates a forecast plot that overlays the training data, test data, and predicted values, allowing visual assessment of model performance. This setup provides a reproducible foundation for budget forecasting that can be extended with additional evaluation metrics or alternative models.
